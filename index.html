<p class="catchPara">Bugs Bunny's catchphrase, "What's up, Doc?",<br>
     is legendary to his character because it effortlessly reflects<br>
      his relaxed vibe, sharp humor, and effortless poise. The way he<br>
       says it, with an easygoing charm and natural confidence, captures<br>
        his cheeky yet intelligent personality. It sums up not just how he<br>
         looks but also his fun-loving and unshakable nature, making it an <br>
         enduring symbol of his essence.</p>
<p class="originPara"> Bugs Bunnyâ€™s "What's up, Doc?" began as Texas slang introduced in the 1940 <br>
    cartoon A Wild Hare. He casually said it to a nervous Elmer Fudd, <br>making his cool, laid-back persona shine.
     The line stuck, and Bugs became an <br>icon of smart-aleck charm. Simple and timeless, right?</p>
